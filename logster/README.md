Logster is a utility for reading log files and generating metrics in Graphite or 
Ganglia. It is ideal for visualizing trends of events that are occurring in your 
application/system/error logs. For example, you might use logster to graph the 
number of occurrences of HTTP response code that appears in your web server logs.
