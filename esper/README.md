Esper is a component for complex event processing (CEP), available 
for Java as Esper, and for .NET as NEsper.

Esper and NEsper enable rapid development of applications that 
process large volumes of incoming messages or events. Esper and NEsper 
filter and analyze events in various ways, and respond to conditions
of interest in real-time.
