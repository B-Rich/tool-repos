Graphite is an enterprise-scale monitoring tool that runs well on cheap 
hardware. It was originally designed and written by Chris Davis at Orbitz in 
2006 as side project that ultimately grew to be a foundational monitoring tool. 
In 2008, Orbitz allowed Graphite to be released under the open source Apache 
2.0 license. Since then Chris has continued to work on Graphite and has 
deployed it at other companies including Sears, where it serves as a pillar of 
the e-commerce monitoring system. Today many large companies use it.
