Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance 
computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical 
design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used 
technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable 
data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses 
carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low 
per-node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been 
ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, 
and is currently in use on thousands of clusters around the world. It has been 
used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can 
scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.

Ganglia is a BSD-licensed open-source project that grew out of the University 
of California, Berkeley Millennium Project which was initially funded in large 
part by the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure 
(NPACI) and National Science Foundation RI Award EIA-9802069. NPACI is funded 
by the National Science Foundation and strives to advance science by creating a 
ubiquitous, continuous, and pervasive national computational infrastructure: 
the Grid. Current support comes from Planet Lab: an open platform for 
developing, deploying, and accessing planetary-scale services.
